How to
1. First check that you have all the softwares installed. 
2. Make a new folder and put these files there
	a. The two scripts, "first.py" and "second.py"
	b. The fire data.(excel file)
	c. The shapefile which you want to modify.
3. First open the excel file containing the fire data and save it as csv file. Give it the following name : "fire_data.csv" Take care of capitalisation.
4. Open this csv file and note down the name of level at which you want the info. You will have to enter this name when you run the script.
5. Run the first script.
6. Enter the data it wants.
7. You will get the frequency in frequency_output.csv file.
8. Now open QGIS
9. Load the project that contains the shapefile in which you want the data entered.
10. Select the layer you want to modify.
11. Open python console.
12. Click show editor button just above the python console.
13. Copy and paste the script and run it.
14. Select your file containing frequency data.(csv file) 
15. Select the level at which you want to enter the frequency data.

Before you use these scripts kindly keep in mind these points
1. The name of beat/range/division should be same on the fire point data and the shapefile.
2. You might need to install pandas library in QGIS. Its python files are seperate from the system one.
3. This script will need python version greater than 3.0
